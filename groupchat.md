# groupchat.md

Timestamped coordination channel for parallel Codex agents.

## Format
Use one line per message with this schema:
MSG | <timestamp> | <agent> | to:<agent|all> | type:<request|ack|info|handoff|release> | locks:<paths|none> | note:<one-line message>

## Rules
1. Append-only: do not edit or delete prior messages.
2. Timestamps must include timezone (local offset).
3. Keep messages one line and actionable.
4. When requesting a handoff, state exact files and expected next action.
5. When releasing work, include 	ype:release with freed paths.
6. Prefer coordination around small, surgical, meaningful changes that move the project forward.
